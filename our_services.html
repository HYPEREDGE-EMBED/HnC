                                <p class="Services paragraph">Our aim is helping you, and your business, implement changes that make a positive difference, and to do so in a way that will ensure those changes are sustainable and long-lasting. While our understanding of what needs
                                    to change is regularly quite well understood, following some analysis, we frequently find that how to change is less clear or less considered.
                                    <br>
There are many theories and tools developed by academics, consultancies, and the so-called "leadership experts" – all will bring some awareness and can be useful in some circumstances,
                                    sometimes.
                                    <br>
As knowledgeable practitioners, we have come across and used many; if not most of them. These experiences have led us to adopt a real-world, pragmatic approach that recognizes that every
                                    organization is different and every situation has its extraordinary challenges.
                                    <br>
These problems entail fresh thinking and a solution that takes into account your particular beliefs, and the type of change required. So no matter the system we are using, it is the
                                    practical use of these tools and stand points that are the hallmark of designing and implementing successful change programs. For us, pragmatism means accepting a theory that is useful for the situation handled! One
                                    of the main principles is that the administration of change is essentially a social process, and is fundamentally about leading, managing and supporting all those persons who will be impacted or who are involved.&nbsp;
                                    <br>
Another norm is that any change of significance is best thought about in a universal way. For us an Integrated Approach means: Leading change consists of engagement from the top AND
                                    active participation from those involved or impacted. The purposes of change should be to deliver beneficial outcomes as well as to develop competencies for the future.
                                    <br>
The emphasis of the change program must consider persons and culture as well as processes, systems and structure. We believe our role to be one and only of supporting and empowering
                                    all those involved, working with leaders, teams and persons, and using our expertise and knowledge to help you to design and then implement a change process that works for youand your company.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p class="Services paragraph">Sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) is the next phase in utilizing that demand administration process. It is a powerful integrated business management process that assists management teams to align and synchronize
                                    their whole organizationin a bid to balance overall demand against supply.
                                    <br>
If you have heard sales blame, the factory/supply chain as the finance team tweaks out their hair over stock spend rates; then S&amp;OP can help optimize the use of your most critical
                                    resources: people, capacity, materials, time and money.
                                    <br>
A correctly applied S&amp;OP process allows your teams to communicate and mutually agree on output on a monthly rolling basis. In our experience, most organizations already embark on
                                    much of the planning work – all that is required is a standard structure and agreement framework that brings the whole thing together and creates a way forward for all and becomes a powerful tool to manage the business.
                                    If applied correctly, S&amp;OP delivers dramatic improvements, cost savings and control with insignificant change. </p>

                                <p class="Services paragraph">Operational excellence enables organizations to decrease waste and become more receptive by challenging the way things are done to optimize the movement in an organization. If used properly, it can change the way teams
                                    think and work. Indeed, we have applied this to generate benefits for a variety of establishments – from lawyer's offices through to the back office functions of public and private sector organizations.
                                    <br>
Our skilled consultants help you apply a permanent improvement atmosphere – where everybody can put forward ideas and have a say in how procedures can change for the better; this depends
                                    greatly on first giving your employees the training they need to understand where they are and how they can advance their work. As a first step, we will typically start a pilot project in a modest area to demonstrate
                                    all the benefits that can be gained, before we roll out the training to your broader workforce using your pilot team as representatives, and as you becomemore efficient, we fade more into the background.
                                    <br>
Finally, we will develop a monitoring and feedback process that keeps the momentum going –so that everybody across your organization is motivated on working every day to make things
                                    better. The unique benefits of this operation include faster, more efficient and less wasteful processes, plus a highly engaged and motivated workforce continually making gradual improvements.&nbsp; </p>
